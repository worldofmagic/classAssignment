                        Manipulating data with XML
                        sometimes requires integrity, authentication and
                        privacy. XML signature, encryption, and xkms can help
                        create a secure environment for XML.
                        What is XML Signature?
                        
                         The XML Signature specification defines digital
                        signature processing rules and syntax. XML Signatures
                        provide integrity, message authentication, andor
                        signer authentication services for data of any type,
                        whether located within the XML that includes the
                        signature or elsewhere.
                        
                         What is XML Encryption?
                        
                         XML Encryption specifies a process for encrypting
                        data and representing the result in XML. The data may
                        be arbitrary data including an XML document, an XML
                        element, or XML element content. The result of
                        encrypting data is an XML Encryption element which
                        contains or references the cipher data
                        
                         What is XKMS?
						The XKMS standard specifies protocols for
                        distributing and registering public keys, suitable for
                        use with the XML Signature and XML Encryption
                        standards.
