                        What is XQuery?
			XQuery is a standardized language for combining
			documents, databases, Web pages and almost anything
			else. It is very widely implemented. It is powerful and
			easy to learn.
                        What is XQuery Used For?
			XQuery is replacing proprietary middleware languages
			and Web Application development languages. XQuery is
			replacing complex Java or C++ programs with a few lines
			of code. XQuery is simpler to work with and easier to
			maintain than many other alternatives.
			It is used as a back end for implementing Web sites,
			integrating corporate data stores in the enterprise, in
			the XRX architecture XForms, REST and XQuery, as well
			as for large publishing projects, for data mining, and
			for academic research.  It can run on large servers and
			on mobile devices, as part of commercial software and
			as open source.
