			  A processing model defines what operations should be
			  performed in what order on an XML document.
                        
                        
                        What is XProc?
                        
                        
			  An unusual characteristic of XML is that documents in that format
			  do not have intrinsic meaning: any XML processor is free to
			  interpret any XML document in any way. This is sometimes called
			  the XML Promise.
			  However, it is often useful to be able to suggest how a
			  particular document might be processed.  The XProc specification
			  provides a way to do that:
			  XProc: An XML Pipeline Language is an XML-based
			  language for describing operations to be performed on XML documents.
			  
			  Note that there is no single processing
			  model for all XML Documents, and there is no
			  default processing model.  XProc XML Pipeline is one example
			  of a way to say how to process an XML document.  You can also
			  have multiple XML Pipelines that you might select from to
			  process a given document.
                        
                        What is XProc Used For?
                        
			Use XProc to say that a particular document or set of documents
			should be processed in a certain order: for example, first XInclude and
			then XSD Schema validation, and then XSLT with a particular XSL stylesheet.
                        
                        Examples
			pipeline xmlns="http:www.w3.orgnsxproc"
xinclude
validate-with-xml-schema
  input port="schema"
    document href="http:example.compathtoschema.xsd"
  input
validate-with-xml-schema
xslt
  input port="stylesheet"
    document href="http:example.compathtostylesheet.xsl"
  input
xslt
			    pipeline
			This example indicates that a document with which this
			pipeline is associated should
			first have XInclude processing done on it,
			then be validated with a specific schema,
			and finally have an XSLT stylesheet applied to
			the result of validation.
