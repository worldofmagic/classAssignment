	Abstract#
	Accessibility of web content requires semantic information about widgets, structures, and behaviors, in order to allow assistive technologies to convey appropriate information to persons with disabilities. This specification provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements and can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. These semantics are designed to allow an author to properly convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies in document-level markup. This document is part of the WAI-ARIA suite described in the WAI-ARIA Overview.

		This is the WAI-ARIA 1.0 W3C Recommendation from the Protocols  Formats Working Group of the Web
						Accessibility Initiative. The Working Group created an implementation report that shows the exit
						criteria have been met. The Director approved transition to Recommendation after
					reviewing this report and after Advisory Committee vote which unanimously supported
					publication. Some editorial changes have been made since the Proposed Recommendation:
					removing suggestions of "RDF ID reference", changing the spelling of "programming" to
					"programing", correcting the spelling of "assistive", and updating some references to
					latest versions.
		This document has been reviewed by W3C
			Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document
			and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to
			draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This
			enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web.

			Comments received on the WAI-ARIA 1.0 Recommendation cannot result in changes to this
			version of the specification, but may be addressed in errata or future versions of
			WAI-ARIA.  The Working Group may not make formal responses to comments but future work
			undertaken by the Working Group may address comments received on this document.
