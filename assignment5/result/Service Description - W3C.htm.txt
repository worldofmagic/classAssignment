A Service Description plays an important role in enabling access to a service. Most service description languages are designed for machine consumption, allowing for the automatic creation of code skeletons, easier search, and classification of services. However, people may also find descriptions useful to learn about the use of parameters or the precise semantics of some operation.

  Data description
  There are several aspects in data description like the definition of the
  data structure, of the type and values, its semantic etc
  For XML, 
  XML Schema provide structural, 
  type and values descriptions;
  For Web Services, WSDL provides, 
  via the use of XML Schema, the data formats flowing in and out;
  SAWSDL provides a way to add 
  semantic descriptions to XML Schema and WDSL descriptions.
  Web Services description
  WSDL defines not only the format and
  values of data flowing in and out of the service, but also define the 
  endpoints, supported operations, message exchange patterns MEP, everything
  relative to the operative description of the Web Services endpoints.
  WS-Choreography describe the 
  flow of messages between a set of services participating in a global
  choreography of exchanges, without having a controller. It can also be used
  to validate a posteriori a serie of logged exchanges between different
  parties. 
  WS Policy describe the policies
  in use when accessing a service, through policy assertions, like security
  policies, transport protocol selection, etc
